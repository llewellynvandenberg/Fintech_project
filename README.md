# Fintech_project

The aim of this project is to estimate credit scores based on transactional history.

The underlying problem being adressed is two-fold --- namely, banks aim to reduce their risk in loaning money, bank clients with little to no credit history do not have accurate credit scores, and banks posess large amounts of transactional data which can be utilised to improve their own systems.
